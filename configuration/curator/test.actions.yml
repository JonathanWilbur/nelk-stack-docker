# This configure file will delete ALL records, because the 45-minutes rounds up
# to today's index, meaning that today's LogStash index and everything older
# gets deleted... which, again, is everything.
#
# This configuration file was taken directly from:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/curator/master/examples/actions/delete_indices.yml.
#
# Remember, leave a key empty if there is no value.  None will be a string,
# not a Python "NoneType"

      Delete indices older than 45 days (based on index name), for logstash-
